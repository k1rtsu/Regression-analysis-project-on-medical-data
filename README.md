## Dataset

The project uses data from the **Framingham Heart Study**.  

The Framingham Heart Study was initiated in 1948 to identify common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) by following its development over time in a group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The researchers recruited 5,209 men and women aged 30 to 62 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. Every two years, a series of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews were conducted.  

This dataset is a subset of the Framingham Heart Study data. It contains **14 columns**, with each row representing a single subject.
